                <h4>They are packaged in plastic bottles.</h4>
                <p>And since only 8% of plastic is actually recycled and plastic never really decomposes, plastic bottles don’t seem very ‘eco-friendly’.</p>

                <h4>Made with SLS to create artificial suds.</h4>
                <p>Most Dish Soaps - even top ‘eco brands’ like 7th Generation - contain SLS, which doesn’t ‘clean’ your dishes, it just makes more suds. According to the David Suzuki Foundation SLS is “… toxic to aquatic organisms.”</p>
